<br><em>What is HTML?</em></p>
<p>is the "language" used to tell a computer what you want it to do. 
<em>html</em> stands for 
<em>hypertext markup language.
</em>html documents are comprised of elements and tags. 
<em>Tags</em> are the specific instructions
that tell the elements what to do and are always in < >. 
<em>tags</em> always have an open  comand and a closing comand. 
<em> Void tags</em> do not require an end tag because it does not contain an element.
<em>Elements</em> refer to everything within a set of "opening" and "closng" tags.
